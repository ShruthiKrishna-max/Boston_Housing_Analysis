This repository contains an exploratory analysis of the **Boston Housing Dataset** using Python. The goal is to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships in housing prices through descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset Overview

The Boston Housing Dataset includes features such as:

- `MEDV`: Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s)
- `RM`: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- Other socioeconomic and environmental factors

## Analysis Highlights

### Distribution of House Prices
- Histogram of `MEDV` shows most houses are in the mid-price range.
- A few high-priced homes create a slight right-skew in the distribution.

### Spread and Outliers
- Boxplots highlight the spread and reveal high-end outliers (likely luxury homes).
- The median price lies closer to the lower half of the range.

### Relationship Between Rooms and Prices
- Scatter plot of `RM` vs `MEDV` shows a positive correlation.
- More rooms generally mean higher house prices.

## Visualizations
- Histogram of Median House Value
- Boxplot of House Prices
- Scatter Plot: Rooms vs Median Price

## Conclusion
The dataset reveals meaningful patterns:
- Most homes fall in the moderate price range
- Outliers indicate luxury properties
- Number of rooms strongly correlates with house value

These insights can guide further analysis and predictive modeling, such as regression for price prediction.
